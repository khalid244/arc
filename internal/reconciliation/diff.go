// The grace window is `cfg.GraceWindow + cfg.ClockSkewAllowance`. Files
// with a zero LastModified are treated as "still young" — i.e. PROTECTED
// from deletion. The fallback `List`+`StatFile` path produces zero
// mtimes when a backend doesn't implement `ObjectLister`; we'd rather
// leak orphan storage than risk deleting a file we can't age-check.
// Production backends (S3, Azure, Local) all implement ObjectLister and
// won't hit this branch; this is purely a safety net for custom
// backends and a hint to operators that they should implement
// ObjectLister to get full reconciliation coverage.

// In BackendLocal mode the per-node OriginNodeID filter applies to
// orphan-storage candidates: files whose manifest twin (if any) named
// a different node as origin are NOT candidates here. Since orphan
// storage means "no manifest entry", we have no OriginNodeID to filter
// against — for local mode we accept that the per-node walk is
// scoped by the backend's physical layout (each node only sees its
// own disks). The scheduler / wiring layer does NOT cross-mount
// remote disks, so the scope is correct.
