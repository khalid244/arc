# Arc v2026.05.1 Release Notes

## Bug Fixes

### Memory Not Released After Delete / Retention Execution

Fixed a memory retention issue where running a retention policy or the delete API endpoint caused Arc to hold onto several GBs of memory that were never released — requiring periodic container restarts to recover.

**Root cause:** DuckDB's internal parquet metadata cache and data block cache were populated during `read_parquet()` queries executed by delete and retention operations, but never cleared after completion. Compaction already performed this cleanup; delete and retention did not.

**Changes:**

- Both the delete handler and retention handler now call `ClearHTTPCache()` after completing their file operations — always, including dry runs and no-match paths, since `read_parquet()` populates the cache regardless of whether rows are actually deleted. This evicts DuckDB's glob result cache, file metadata cache, and data block cache for the files that were rewritten or deleted.
- `debug.FreeOSMemory()` is debounced via atomic CAS and fires at most once every 30 seconds in a background goroutine. This prevents GC storms when multiple concurrent delete or retention requests complete in rapid succession, while still returning freed heap pages to the OS promptly.
- The delete file-rewrite COPY queries now include `ROW_GROUP_SIZE 122880` (extracted as a named constant `parquetRowGroupSize`), matching the compaction writer. This limits DuckDB's internal write buffer per row group, reducing peak memory during large rewrites.

**Impact:** Memory usage should return to baseline after a retention policy run or delete operation, instead of climbing GBs per execution. Particularly noticeable in Docker/Kubernetes deployments with memory limits, where this could cause OOM kills during nightly retention runs.

## Dependencies

### AWS SDK v2 (S3/S3-compatible storage)

Bumped `aws-sdk-go-v2` core (1.40→1.41.5), `service/s3` (1.92→1.99), `aws/protocol/eventstream` (1.7.3→1.7.8), and all internal sub-packages. Key fixes:

- DNS timeout errors are now retried automatically, improving S3 reliability on flaky networks
- Fix for config load failure when a non-existent AWS profile is configured
- `smithy-go` 1.23→1.24 protocol layer update
