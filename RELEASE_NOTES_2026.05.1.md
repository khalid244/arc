# Arc v2026.05.1 Release Notes

## Bug Fixes

### Query Registry Reports 0 Row Count for Arrow-Path Queries

Fixed a bug where the query registry always recorded `row_count = 0` for queries served via the Arrow path.

**Root cause:** `queryRegistry.Complete(queryID, 0)` was called synchronously right after `arrowJSONQueryFunc` returned, but the Arrow path streams its response asynchronously via `SetBodyStreamWriter`. At that point the real row count from `streamArrowJSON` is not yet known — so 0 was always hardcoded. Additionally, the Arrow path's error and timeout branches returned `handled=true` without notifying the registry at all, leaving queries stuck in "running" state permanently.

**Fix:** Added `onComplete func(int)`, `onFail func(string)`, and `onTimeout func()` callbacks to `executeArrowJSONQuery`. The call site in `query.go` passes closures that invoke the appropriate registry method. The success path calls `onComplete(rc)` inside the `SetBodyStreamWriter` callback with the real row count; the error and timeout paths call `onFail`/`onTimeout` immediately before returning.

**Impact:** The query registry now correctly reflects row counts, failure reasons, and timeout status for all Arrow-path queries.

### Low-Volume Measurements Starved of Age-Based Flushes Under High Write Load

Fixed a bug in the ArrowBuffer periodic flush goroutine where low-volume measurements could be indefinitely starved of age-based flushing when a high-volume workload was running concurrently.

**Root cause:** `periodicFlush` unconditionally reset its self-adjusting timer every time a new buffer was created (signalled via `newBufferCh`). Under high write load, high-volume measurements hit their size limit frequently, triggering size-based flushes followed by immediate buffer re-creation — each re-creation sent a `newBufferCh` signal. This caused the timer to be continuously reset to `now + maxAge`, pushing the flush deadline out and preventing low-volume buffers (which rely solely on age-based flushing) from ever being flushed within the expected window.

**Fix:** The timer is now only reset when the new computed deadline is earlier than the already-scheduled deadline. If a new buffer's expiry is further in the future than the current timer, the timer is left unchanged. This guarantees that an existing pending flush deadline is never extended by a newer, shorter-lived buffer.

**Impact:** Low-volume measurements (e.g. alerts, heartbeats, status events) now reliably flush within `max_buffer_age_ms` even when co-located with high-throughput measurements on the same Arc instance.

### Memory Not Released After Delete / Retention Execution

Fixed a memory retention issue where running a retention policy or the delete API endpoint caused Arc to hold onto several GBs of memory that were never released — requiring periodic container restarts to recover.

**Root cause:** DuckDB's internal parquet metadata cache and data block cache were populated during `read_parquet()` queries executed by delete and retention operations, but never cleared after completion. Compaction already performed this cleanup; delete and retention did not.

**Changes:**

- Both the delete handler and retention handler now call `ClearHTTPCache()` after completing their file operations — always, including dry runs and no-match paths, since `read_parquet()` populates the cache regardless of whether rows are actually deleted. This evicts DuckDB's glob result cache, file metadata cache, and data block cache for the files that were rewritten or deleted.
- `debug.FreeOSMemory()` is debounced via atomic CAS and fires at most once every 30 seconds in a background goroutine. This prevents GC storms when multiple concurrent delete or retention requests complete in rapid succession, while still returning freed heap pages to the OS promptly.
- The delete file-rewrite COPY queries now include `ROW_GROUP_SIZE 122880` (extracted as a named constant `parquetRowGroupSize`), matching the compaction writer. This limits DuckDB's internal write buffer per row group, reducing peak memory during large rewrites.

**Impact:** Memory usage should return to baseline after a retention policy run or delete operation, instead of climbing GBs per execution. Particularly noticeable in Docker/Kubernetes deployments with memory limits, where this could cause OOM kills during nightly retention runs.

## Dependencies

### DuckDB v1.5.1

Upgraded DuckDB Go binding from `v2.5.5` (DuckDB 1.4.4) to `v2.10501.0` (DuckDB 1.5.1). All platform-specific binary packages (`duckdb-go-bindings`, `lib/darwin-arm64`, `lib/linux-amd64`, `lib/linux-arm64`, `lib/windows-amd64`) updated in lockstep.

### AWS SDK v2 (S3/S3-compatible storage)

Bumped `aws-sdk-go-v2` core (1.40→1.41.5), `service/s3` (1.92→1.99), `aws/protocol/eventstream` (1.7.3→1.7.8), and all internal sub-packages. Key fixes:

- DNS timeout errors are now retried automatically, improving S3 reliability on flaky networks
- Fix for config load failure when a non-existent AWS profile is configured
- `smithy-go` 1.23→1.24 protocol layer update
