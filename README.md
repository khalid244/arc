High-performance time-series database for Aerospace, Defense, and Industrial IoT. 18.6M records/sec. Satellite tracking, launch telemetry, ground stations, manufacturing, energy. DuckDB SQL + Parquet + Arrow. AGPL-3.0

---

## The Problem

Aerospace, defense, and industrial systems generate massive telemetry at scale:

* **Aerospace & Defense**: Satellite constellations, launch vehicles, ground stations, orbital tracking
* **Space Operations**: 14K+ objects in orbit, TLE data, SGP4 propagation, conjunction analysis
* **Industrial IoT**: Manufacturing telemetry, mining sensors, equipment monitoring
* **Energy & Utilities**: Grid monitoring, smart meters, renewable output, pipeline sensors
* **Transportation**: Racing telemetry, fleet tracking, logistics optimization
* **Healthcare**: Patient monitoring, medical devices, clinical studies
* **Observability**: Metrics, logs, traces from distributed systems

Traditional time-series databases weren't built for aerospace workloads:
- ITAR compliance requires self-hosted infrastructure
- Mission-critical systems can't risk vendor lock-in
- Burst ingestion during satellite passes (10M+ metrics/sec → silence → burst)
- Multi-decade retention for space missions
- Sub-second queries for real-time decision making

**Arc solves this: 18.6M records/sec ingestion, sub-second queries on billions of rows, portable Parquet files you own, ITAR-ready self-hosted deployment.**

```sql
-- Track satellite orbital elements over time
SELECT
  satellite_id,
  norad_id,
  epoch,
  inclination,
  eccentricity,
  mean_motion,
  LAG(mean_motion) OVER (PARTITION BY satellite_id ORDER BY epoch) as prev_mean_motion,
  mean_motion - LAG(mean_motion) OVER (PARTITION BY satellite_id ORDER BY epoch) as orbital_decay
FROM tle.satellites
WHERE satellite_id LIKE 'Starlink%'
  AND epoch > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY satellite_id, epoch DESC;

-- Analyze ground station contact windows
SELECT
  ground_station_id,
  satellite_id,
  MAX(signal_strength) as peak_signal,
  AVG(data_rate) as avg_throughput,
  SUM(bytes_received) as total_data
FROM telemetry.contacts
WHERE contact_start > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY ground_station_id, satellite_id
HAVING AVG(data_rate) > 1000000;  -- 1 Mbps minimum

-- Industrial equipment monitoring
SELECT
  device_id,
  facility_name,
  AVG(temperature) OVER (
    PARTITION BY device_id
    ORDER BY timestamp
    ROWS BETWEEN 10 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) as temp_moving_avg,
  MAX(pressure) as peak_pressure
FROM iot.sensors
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
  AND facility_id IN ('plant_7', 'mining_site_42')
HAVING MAX(pressure) > 850;
```

**Standard DuckDB SQL. Window functions, CTEs, joins. No proprietary query language.**

## Performance

Benchmarked on Apple MacBook Pro M3 Max (14 cores, 36GB RAM, 1TB NVMe).
Test config: 12 concurrent workers, 1000-record batches, IoT sensor data.

### Ingestion

| Protocol | Throughput | p50 Latency | p99 Latency |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| MessagePack Columnar | **18.6M rec/s** | 0.46ms | 3.68ms |
| MessagePack + Zstd | 16.8M rec/s | 0.55ms | 3.23ms |
| MessagePack + GZIP | 15.4M rec/s | 0.63ms | 3.17ms |
| Line Protocol | 3.7M rec/s | 2.63ms | 10.63ms |

### Compaction

Automatic background compaction merges small Parquet files into optimized larger files:

| Metric | Before | After | Reduction |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Files | 43 | 1 | 97.7% |
| Size | 372 MB | 36 MB | **90.4%** |

Benefits:
- **10x storage reduction** via better compression and encoding
- **Faster queries** - scan 1 file vs 43 files
- **Lower cloud costs** - less storage, fewer API calls

### Query (February 2026)

Arrow IPC format provides 2x throughput vs JSON for large result sets:

| Query | Arrow (ms) | JSON (ms) | Speedup |
|-------|------------|-----------|---------|
| COUNT(*) - 963M rows | 2.5 | 1.9 | 0.76x |
| SELECT LIMIT 10K | 39 | 40 | 1.03x |
| SELECT LIMIT 100K | 70 | 103 | 1.48x |
| SELECT LIMIT 500K | 207 | 380 | **1.84x** |
| SELECT LIMIT 1M | 378 | 742 | **1.96x** |
| Time Range (7d) LIMIT 10K | 13 | 16 | 1.20x |
| Time Bucket (1h, 7d) | 281 | 276 | 0.98x |
| Date Trunc (day, 30d) | 1045 | 1059 | 1.01x |

**Best throughput:**
- Arrow: **2.64M rows/sec** (1M row SELECT)
- JSON: **1.35M rows/sec** (1M row SELECT)
- COUNT(*): **~510B rows/sec** (963M rows, 1.9ms)

## Why Go

- **Stable memory**: Go's GC returns memory to OS. No leaks.
- **Single binary**: Deploy one executable. No dependencies.
- **Native concurrency**: Goroutines handle thousands of connections efficiently.
- **Production GC**: Sub-millisecond pause times at scale.

## Configuration

Arc uses TOML configuration with environment variable overrides.

```toml
[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8000

[storage]
backend = "local"        # local, s3, minio
local_path = "./data/arc"

[ingest]
flush_interval = "5s"
max_buffer_size = 50000

[auth]
enabled = true
```

Environment variables use `ARC_` prefix:

```bash
export ARC_SERVER_PORT=8000
export ARC_STORAGE_BACKEND=s3
export ARC_AUTH_ENABLED=true
```

See [arc.toml](./arc.toml) for complete configuration reference.
