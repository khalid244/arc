High-performance columnar analytical database. 19M+ records/sec ingestion, 8M+ rows/sec queries. Ingestion, storage, compaction, SQL queries, retention policies, and continuous queries — in one binary. Open Parquet files on your storage. No vendor lock-in. AGPL-3.0.

---

## The Problem

Modern applications generate massive amounts of data that needs fast ingestion and analytical queries:

* **Product Analytics**: Events, clickstreams, user behavior, A/B testing
* **Observability**: Metrics, logs, traces from distributed systems
* **AI Agent Memory**: Conversation history, context, RAG, embeddings
* **Edge & Tactical**: Disconnected operations, tactical edge platforms, sensor telemetry, MQTT-native
* **Industrial IoT**: Manufacturing telemetry, sensors, equipment monitoring
* **Security & Compliance**: Audit logs, SIEM, security events
* **Data Warehousing**: Analytics, BI, reporting on time-series or event data

Traditional solutions have problems:
- **Expensive**: Cloud data warehouses cost thousands per month at scale
- **Complex**: ClickHouse/Druid require cluster management expertise
- **Vendor lock-in**: Proprietary formats trap your data
- **Slow ingestion**: Most analytical DBs struggle with high-throughput writes
- **Overkill**: Need simple deployment, not Kubernetes orchestration

**Arc solves this: 19M+ records/sec ingestion, 6M+ rows/sec queries, portable Parquet files you own, single binary deployment.**

## What Arc is (and isn't)

Arc is a complete analytical database: ingestion pipeline, storage engine, compaction system, SQL query layer, retention policy manager, continuous query scheduler, and MQTT subscriber — in one binary. It uses DuckDB as its query engine the same way PostgreSQL uses its own, but Arc adds everything the query engine doesn't: high-throughput ingestion with automatic Parquet flushing, background compaction, scheduled compute, data lifecycle management, authentication, backup and restore, and enterprise clustering.

Arc is **not a wrapper**. You don't bring your own ingestion, compaction, or retention policies. Arc provides the full stack.

```sql
-- Product analytics: user events
SELECT
  user_id,
  event_type,
  COUNT(*) as event_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as sessions
FROM analytics.events
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
  AND event_type IN ('page_view', 'click', 'purchase')
GROUP BY user_id, event_type
HAVING COUNT(*) > 100;

-- Observability: error rate by service
SELECT
  service_name,
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) as hour,
  COUNT(*) as total_requests,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status >= 500 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as errors,
  (SUM(CASE WHEN status >= 500 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::FLOAT / COUNT(*)) * 100 as error_rate
FROM logs.http_requests
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY service_name, hour
HAVING error_rate > 1.0;

-- AI agent memory: conversation search
SELECT
  agent_id,
  conversation_id,
  user_message,
  assistant_response,
  created_at
FROM ai.conversations
WHERE agent_id = 'support-bot-v2'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
  AND user_message ILIKE '%refund%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Standard SQL. Window functions, CTEs, joins, aggregations. No proprietary query language.**

## Performance

Benchmarked on Apple MacBook Pro M3 Max (14 cores, 36GB RAM, 1TB NVMe).
Test config: 12 concurrent workers, 1000-record batches, columnar data.

### Ingestion

| Protocol | Throughput | p50 Latency | p99 Latency |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| MessagePack Columnar | **19.9M rec/s** | 0.43ms | 2.95ms |
| MessagePack + Zstd | 16.5M rec/s | 0.60ms | 2.70ms |
| MessagePack + GZIP | 16.5M rec/s | 0.60ms | 2.71ms |
| Line Protocol | 5.5M rec/s | 1.77ms | 7.13ms |

### Compaction

Automatic background compaction merges small Parquet files into optimized larger files:

| Metric | Before | After | Reduction |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Files | 43 | 1 | 97.7% |
| Size | 372 MB | 36 MB | **90.4%** |

Benefits:
- **10x storage reduction** via better compression and encoding
- **Faster queries** - scan 1 file vs 43 files
- **Lower cloud costs** - less storage, fewer API calls

### Query (May 2026)

Arc speaks three wire formats from the same query engine. **Arrow IPC** is the throughput leader for analytical clients (Grafana, pyarrow, polars) that can take an Arrow dependency — zero-copy from the engine's internal columnar buffers. **MessagePack** (experimental, columnar) is the choice for clients that don't speak Arrow but want smaller bytes and faster decode than JSON — same envelope shape as JSON, native binary types for timestamps and binary columns. **JSON** stays the default for ergonomic compatibility.

Benchmark: 393.7M-row `cpu` measurement, 5 iterations per query, M3 Max. Latency is p50 in milliseconds. The five SELECT-LIMIT rows were measured back-to-back in the same session so the three columns are apples-to-apples; the DuckDB-bound rows (Time Bucket, Date Trunc, GROUP BY) are dominated by query execution and converge across wire formats.

| Query | JSON (ms) | MessagePack (ms) | Arrow IPC (ms) | msgpack vs JSON | Arrow vs JSON |
|-------|----------:|-----------------:|---------------:|----------------:|--------------:|
| COUNT(*) — 393.7M rows | 1.03 | 1.03 | 0.86 | 1.00x | 1.20x |
| SELECT LIMIT 10K | 18.4 | 16.6 | 14.7 | 1.11x | 1.25x |
| SELECT LIMIT 100K | 48.1 | 33.2 | 31.0 | **1.45x** | **1.55x** |
| SELECT LIMIT 500K | 173.2 | 81.1 | 61.1 | **2.14x** | **2.84x** |
| SELECT LIMIT 1M | 334.2 | **133.6** | **105.4** | **2.49x** | **3.17x** |
| Time Range (7d) LIMIT 10K | 15.0 | 15.5 | 15.5 | 0.97x | 0.97x |
| Time Bucket (1h, 7d) | 4.7 | 4.8 | 4.7 | 0.98x | 1.00x |
| Date Trunc (day, 30d) | 416 | 415 | 413 | 1.00x | 1.01x |
| GROUP BY host | 452 | 450 | 450 | 1.00x | 1.00x |
| GROUP BY host + hour | 645 | 660 | 672 | 0.98x | 0.96x |

**Best throughput on LIMIT 1M (1M-row payload, single connection):**
- Arrow IPC: **9.49M rows/sec** (105.4ms)
- MessagePack: **7.49M rows/sec** (133.6ms)
- JSON: **2.99M rows/sec** (334.2ms)
- COUNT(*): **~382B rows/sec equivalent** (393.7M rows in 1.03ms — parquet footer reads, not a row scan)

**Notes on the table:** the wire-format speedups manifest on response-heavy queries (≥100k rows) where encoding dominates the per-request wall time. For aggregations (Time Bucket, Date Trunc, GROUP BY) the response is tiny — a few rows — and DuckDB execution is 99%+ of the wall time; all three formats converge. The Arrow IPC win comes from a memcpy of the column buffer; the MessagePack endpoint walks each cell through a typed columnar encoder (one type-switch per column, not per row) and lands at ~78% of Arrow IPC's throughput while remaining decodable by any msgpack client without an Arrow dependency.

The MessagePack endpoint is **experimental** (gated behind the `duckdb_arrow` build tag, no operator-tunable row cap yet) — see the 26.06.1 release notes for the wire-format spec, operational constraints, and the columnar-redesign story.

## Single binary. Zero dependencies.

Arc deploys as one statically-linked executable. No JVM, no Python environment, no PostgreSQL cluster to manage, no ZooKeeper ensemble to babysit. Run it on a laptop, a factory edge box, a battlefield server, or a Kubernetes cluster. Same binary, same config surface.

- **Air-gap ready**: No external services required at runtime. No license server, no cloud dependency.
- **Edge to cloud**: Deploy at the tactical edge, in a sovereign cloud, or on-premises.
- **Minimal footprint**: One process. Memory usage proportional to active workload, not fleet size.

## Configuration

Arc uses TOML configuration with environment variable overrides.

```toml
[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8000

[storage]
backend = "local"        # local, s3, minio
local_path = "./data/arc"

[ingest]
flush_interval = "5s"
max_buffer_size = 50000

[auth]
enabled = true
```

Environment variables use `ARC_` prefix:

```bash
export ARC_SERVER_PORT=8000
export ARC_STORAGE_BACKEND=s3
export ARC_AUTH_ENABLED=true
```

See [arc.toml](./arc.toml) for complete configuration reference.
