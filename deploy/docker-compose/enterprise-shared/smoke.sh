# Pattern 2 multi-writer smoke harness.
#
# Three scenarios share one harness:
#   base                 — boot 3 writers + 1 reader, ingest N records via
#                          Traefik LB, query through reader, assert count.
#   non-leader-crash     — same, but kill a non-leader writer mid-ingest.
#                          Asserts: writes that succeeded HTTP-side are
#                          all queryable; LB drained the dead writer.
#   leader-crash         — same, but kill the current Raft leader mid-ingest.
#                          Asserts: Raft elects a new leader within a few
#                          seconds; writes continue; succeeded writes are
#                          all queryable.
#
# What this validates end-to-end (from PR1a):
#   - cluster.shared_storage_mode=true accepted by startup validation
#   - all 3 writers come up healthy and serve /ready=200 after WAL replay
#   - Traefik LB distributes writes across writers (Pattern 2: every writer
#     accepts ingest, no leader-forwarding)
#   - writers PUT to the shared MinIO bucket with non-colliding filenames
#   - reader queries pick up records flushed by all writers
#   - HA via LB retry: a writer crash is recovered by /ready draining; the
#     LB stops routing to it within one poll cycle
#   - HA via Raft: a leader crash triggers election; the new leader picks
#     up singleton-task ownership (retention/CQ/delete) for the next tick
#
# Usage:
#   export ARC_LICENSE_KEY="ARC-ENT-..."     # dev key, NOT the customer key
#   export ARC_CLUSTER_SHARED_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
#   ./smoke.sh                                # default: scenario=base, 1000 records
